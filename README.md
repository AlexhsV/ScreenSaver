You are asked to implement a kind of "screen saver" in which a number of balls (a certain number of
by the user) will move on the computer screen at random initial angles. When the balls will
reach the boundaries of the screen (right-left-up-down) it should bounce at a corresponding angle.
The movement of the balls will continue indefinitely until the user closes the application (probability
from the taskbar).
